## Connection to the cause

### Corporate mission statements
It is commonplace for companies to have mission and vision statements these days.
Once identified as a differentiator (Good to Great?), the mission statement is
now pervasive and benign. It isn't that too many companies having a mission statement
has stripped such statements of value. It is simply that there are so many valueless
mission statements, most employees scoff at their existence.

With Fortune 500 companies sporting missions statements such as,
"Profitable growth through superior customer service, innovation, quality and
commitment." to, "The purpose of [our company] is to earn money for its
shareholders and increase the value of their investment. We will do that
through growing the company, controlling assets and properly structuring the
balance sheet, thereby increasing EPS, cash flow, and return on invested capital."

These mission statements don't tell us a thing about the company, why they
exist, or what services or goods they actually offer.
With a focus on profit, growth, or return on shareholder value, these companies
seem to think they exist to make money.
Customer service and quality of product are a means to an end; sustainable profits
in service of shareholders.
Having been both a shareholder and employee of a number of companies, I can tell
you shareholder value was way down on the list of things that inspired me.
I was excited by the notion of "Making the World of Software Development
a Better Place to Work" or "Empowering the Local Business".

When I first arrived at Groupon, the phrase "Love Local" was part of the culture.
From T-Shirts, to banners and coffee mugs, everyone knew why we were there
- to empower the local business.
Mom and Pop businesses.
Companies that are founded by your neighbors, employ your neighbors, and care
about your local community because they are genuinely members of said community.

When the founding CEO was asked to step down and one of the primary investors
stepped in to the CEO role, the company lost almost all connection with the mission.

In the interest of return on shareholder value, the
company expanded into different verticals trying to catch more lightening in a
bottle and keep their now inflated "growth company" valuation high.

I remember when the travel division, known as "Getaways" was started.
I asked how this fit in with local businesses.
"Oh, well you see, we're pointing people to bed and breakfast companies.
The customer may be traveling, but we're still helping them discover new local
businesses.
Businesses that are local to where they are at the moment."

"Interesting twist.", I thought.

But that's not actually how it played out.
The Getaways site launched with extremely limited options.
Groupon was faced with the arduous task of building an inventory of local
hotels and bed & breakfast joints or they could partner with a provider that had
hotels available in most major cities and have a complete vertical overnight.
Despite a sales and customer service department adept at growing a business
through direct sales and high-touch vendor service and despite deep cash
reserves, this time Groupon opted for the fast path to profitability and
Getaways became the new model.
Launch it fast, scale it faster, and push it to profitable or kill it.
First bolster the top line, then squeeze to get the bottom line.

Repeatedly rushing into and quickly abandoning verticals in an effort to
provide a better return on shareholder value, the company became progressively
fractured and internally competitive.
Each new vertical knew that they were going to "save the company".
Big egos and grand plans abound, internal competition was encouraged.
Winners were lavished with praise and losers were quietly and expeditiously exited.
Heroes rose and fell in grand displays as the reality of the environment showed
us time and again that success and skill are not necessarily correlated under
these conditions.
They bred bullies and then chastised them for not playing nice with others
once they were no longer too valuable to mess with.

Once united in a common cause, people were now members of "Getaways" or "Goods"
or "Payments" or "Live" or "Local" or any of a number of fleeting and
flailing efforts.

In an effort to show that the company had indeed not lost its way, the CEO
eventually redefined "Local" to mean "anywhere a consumer is".
He spoke of the "Shopping Mall in your pocket."
If you are inspired by the notion of empowering local mom and pop businesses, you
are likely repulsed by the notion of a shopping mall, in pocket or otherwise.
This new definition was an attempt to create a thin thread between the original
inspiration and the new mission to sell anything to anybody anywhere through the
mall in their pants.

Those who were inspired by the original mission were not fooled.
Those who were more aligned to their vertical were not inspired.
A couple of years focused on money over mission and Groupon leadership drove the
company into the ground.

As of this writing, the second CEO has stepped down and there is a new CEO in
his place.
Time will tell what happens to the once "fastest growing company in history."

To be in business in order to make money is like to be alive in order to eat.
You've got it backwards and the decisions you make as a result are more likely
to be detrimental than beneficial.
Greed leads to poor corporate health as surely as gluttony leads to poor
personal health.

Another common issue with mission statements is that they are too broad.
A mission statement that includes several objectives provides little clarity.
Let's take a look at the following Fortune 500 company mission statement:

"We will build a unique portfolio of beauty and related brands, striving to surpass our
competitors in quality, innovation and value, and elevating our image to become the
beauty company most women turn to worldwide. We will become the destination store for
women, offering the convenience of multiple brands and channels, and providing a
personal high touch shopping experience that helps create lifelong customer relationships.
We will expand our presence in direct selling and lead the reinvention of the channel,
offering an entrepreneurial opportunity that delivers superior earnings, recognition,
service and support, making it easy and rewarding to be affiliated with [us] and elevating
the image of our industry. We will be known for our leadership edge, through our passion
for high standards, our respect for diversity and our commitment to create exceptional
opportunities for professional growth so that associates can fulfill their highest potential.
We will be a committed global champion for the health and well-being of women through
philanthropic efforts that eliminate breast cancer from the face of the earth,
and that empower women to achieve economic independence. We will deliver superior
returns to our shareholders by tirelessly pursuing new growth opportunities while
continually improving our profitability, a socially responsible, ethical company
that is watched and emulated as a model of success."

Let's break this one down.

This company is going to be the leading women's beauty company worldwide,
be a destination store with a high-touch experience,
reinvent direct selling,
offer superior entrepreneurial opportunities,
empower women to economic independence,
elevate the image of their entire industry,
be known for leadership,
eliminate breast cancer,
and deliver superior returns to shareholders.

This is an inspiring read.
I imagine many who read this would say,
"These are wonderful, meaningful and inspiring goals. I'd like to work for
this company."

The challenge is the breadth of the statement.
If you work for this company and are in the third quarter of a down-turn,
do you cut back on contributions to philanthropic organizations providing
leading breast cancer research, do you adjust compensation structures for
your independent (entrepreneurial) direct sellers, or do you provide
shareholders with a lower return or even a loss?

And if there is a rise in demand for beauty products for men, do you enter that
market or not?
Entering the men's market allows for growth and better returns which
also allows for larger philanthropic contributions.
It may elevate the image of the industry, depending on how that's defined.
It may show great leadership.
But it is inconsistent with the goal to be the leading women's beauty company.

In my opinion, a short and simple statement such as,
"To improve the wellbeing of women everywhere through economic opportunities
with a focus on health and beauty.",
is a significant improvement over the existing 1500+ word statement.
This short, simple statement provides clarity and flexibility.
If you don't care about the wellbeing of women everywhere, don't join this
company.
If you are not interested in health and beauty, don't join this company.
If you do care about the wellbeing of women everywhere and are interested in
health and beauty, this may be a good company for you.
And when faced with challenges or opportunities, this company is better able
to make decisions that are consistent with this simple statement.

### Why and The Golden Circle
In Simon Sinek's 2009 book, "Start with Why", he explains that great companies
start with "why".
To help clarify the idea, he introduces the notion of the "Golden Circle".

![Golden Circle](images/golden-circle.jpg)

This circle has three layers to it:

*Why* - This is the core belief of the business. It's why the business exists.

*How* - This is how the business fulfills that core belief.

*What* - This is what the company does to fulfill that core belief.

Sinek posits that most companies think backwards.
Rather than starting at the center with "why" or purpose, they start at the
outer-most ring, or "what" and then try to figure out "how".
Many companies fail to take a serious look at why they even exist.
Some actually do not know the answer to this question.

"Does this matter?", you ask.

According to the research detailed in Sinek's book, yes it does matter.
According to Sinek, "People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it."

Let's look at two possible sales pitches for a home appliance company.
The first starts with "what".

> "We make amazing refrigerators. They're beautiful in design, energy efficient,
 and easy to use. Want to buy one?"

 Not bad. I like beautiful design and ease of use in many of the products I buy.
 And for a refrigerator, energy efficient is certainly an attractive feature.

 But what if the same company created their pitch by starting with "why"?

 > "In all that we do, we aim to exceed expectation and be boldly different.
 We believe the status quo is not only boring, but dangerous.
 Our products are beautiful in design, good for the planet, and easy to use.
 Among them are some remarkable refrigerators. Want to buy one?"

See how different that feels?
Maybe it feels better. Maybe it feels worse.
But the distinction is that it made you feel.
The first pitch may have made you think, but it did not touch your primal self.

Perhaps two examples from real companies will help.
Teamwork.com and Asana are two companies competing in the same fundamental space
of project management software.
There are a number of companies in this space, but we've chosen these two
because they both have a mission statement publicly accessible on their web site.
Many of the other companies in this market, such as Microsoft, Pivotal Labs,
and Atlassian are broader technology companies that happen to have a project
management tool in their portfolio.
For those that do make their mission statement publicly available, they tend to
be more general, applying to the company's overall business as opposed to a
specific division.

Teamwork.com's mission is
"To make the world's most easy-to-use, fastest and best Project Management
System."

Asana's mission, in contrast, is
"To help humanity thrive by enabling all teams to work together effortlessly."

Teamwork.com's mission is focused on what; making project management software.
Asana's mission is focused on why; helping humanity thrive through teamwork.

And while, admittedly, Teamwork.com is going to have some initial appeal for
developers who are clearly first class citizens of the company, building a
Project Management System doesn't speak to the heart for most of us.
It speaks to purpose or utility. It satisfies a need.

At Asana, on the other hand, you're helping humanity thrive by
writing software that fosters collaboration across multiple teams and
initiatives. This speaks to the heart. This aspires to solve a much larger
problem.


Companies that start with why are able to attract customers and employees
who share their fundamental beliefs.
And equally important, are able to filter out customers and employees who
are neutral or negative toward the company's "why".
This creates stronger ties between the company and the people that choose to
associate with it.
The end result is greater sales, higher employee retention, and lower costs.

This is the connection to the cause.
A connection with why the company exists.
A sense of alignment and belonging that resonates from the heart, not just the
mind.
