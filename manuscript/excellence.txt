# Excellence

Excellence is about both personal mastery and the quality of the product we
produce.
Teams and individuals must be adequately challenged and be able to see true
progress toward a goal they aspire to.


It is not only important that people are connected to a mission or purpose, but
that they can see steady progress in their endeavor to achieve the desired end.

"Knowledge worker" is a term coined in the late 1950s by American management consultant,
educator, and author, Peter Drucker. Drucker considered knowledge work and
knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management.
While there is no formal definition of the term, knowledge workers are generally
considered people whose work requires specific knowledge and problem solving
abilities, such as physicians, scientists, software engineers, and architects.

For knowledge workers, nothing is more important than making visible progress in meaningful work.
Studies to evaluate the makings of a "good" work day versus a "bad" work day found
that people feeling motivated and happy at the end of a given workday were highly
likely to have made some progress that same day. Conversely, if the person
drags out of the office disengaged and joyless, a setback is most likely to blame.

While positive progress improves engagement and satisfaction, setbacks tend to
be far more powerful. A small step forward does not boost engagement to the same
degree that a small setback decreases engagement. Large wins have a punctuated
impact on engagement, but the boost does not last long. As a result, we know that
small frequent positive progress is essential to long-term engagement.

But positive progress alone is still not enough to maintain engagement.
The work has to be meaningful.
Meaningful not necessarily to the world at large, but meaningful to the individual
performing the work itself.
Certainly endeavors such as eradicating homelessness or curing cancer can bring
meaning to the work, but meaning can be as simple as making a quality product a
customer cares about and enjoys using.
Meaning can come from providing a service to a community or controlling costs
and increasing profits for one's employer.
Simple or grand, goals that are meaningful to the worker where one can see how
their efforts contribute to progress toward those goals can invigorate
inner work life and engagement.

Most modern work is knowledge work.
Knowledge work need not be bolstered in any way to help workers find meaning.
Most knowledge work jobs are potentially meaningful for the people doing them.
The challenge is more in how management removes a sense of purpose from the work
and fails to draw clear connections between the work and the overall organizational
goals.
Managers need not make knowledge work more meaningful, but they do need to stop actively
stripping meaning from the work.

According to a study of hundreds of knowledge workers, there are four key ways
in which managers stripped work of its meaning -
Dismissing or completely ignoring the importance of people's work or ideas,
destroying people's sense of ownership through frequent reassignment,
giving people the impression that nobody will see, use, or benefit from their efforts,
and keeping people generally uninformed about project risks until they are realized.

Knowledge work is primarily about solving problems, often complex problems that
require specific knowledge and unique approaches.
For many knowledge workers, they've spent years studying and practicing before securing even an entry level job.
They're well educated, well informed, and experienced.
Many have worked in internships and other real world opportunities where they've
developed tacit knowledge to compliment the explicit knowledge acquired through
formal schooling.
The number one thing they have to contribute to work and to the cause is ideas.
Dismiss or ignore the key thing they have to contribute, and their motivation
is readily lost.

Unfortunately, in many organizations, new employee ideas are given little consideration.
It is not until the employee has proven they can contribute in small ways the
team and managers agree with that they are then allowed to contribute on a larger scale.
In other words, it is not until the employee has proven their similarity to
the rest of the group that the team considers them credible.
It is often not until we know new employees think the same as us that we put them into
work situations that require diversity of thought.
We'll cover more on diversity of thought in later chapters, but for now, know that it
is a key part of a successful knowledge work environment.
The material aspect of this dialogue, for now, is that in giving lesser consideration
to those whose perspectives differ form general consensus, the organization is
not only losing out on an opportunity to truly innovate, but disenfranchising
and demotivating those they've identified as most worthy of employment.

### Collective ownership is still ownership
Write about how complex problems require small diverse groups to solve them, but
this collective effort doesn't eliminate the sense of pride of ownership.
Moving people from project to project against their will/wishes disallows them
to develop a sense of connection and belonging.
Without a sense of ownership; an ability to see their work through, they can
lose motivation and drive.


## Hawthorn Effect

***TODO: Look up Friedman (Friedman's Thermostat)***

## Friedman's Thermostat
[Friedman] was economic advisor to US President Ronald Regan.
During a debate/discussion over the interpretation of key financial measurements,
Friedman gave a warning in the form of a parable.
Begging apology of Friedman, here's my retelling of the parable.

### The case against thermostats
Imagine for a moment, that you are the ruler of a sovereign province.
The people are happy under your rule.
There is plenty of food to go around, everyone has meaningful work that contributes
to the overall health and wellbeing of the people.
There is time for leisure and your people want for very little.
If there were one wish; one thing the people would like, it would be for the winters to be less harsh.
Summers in the land are wonderful with long comfortable days, lush green lands, and blue skies.
Spring and Fall are equally beautiful in their varying colors and the cooler, but comfortable temperatures.
But winter is harshly cold and the days are short.
A mere three months out of twelve, the winters are nearly insufferable.
The nights may be long, but sleep is hard to come by.
Families must take shifts tending to the fire and everyone must huddle together
in the main room to keep warm; man and pet.

One day, you hear of a land not so far away where the people do not suffer through
the winter.
A land where despite the cold, the homes are warm throughout.
These people have a mysterious device in every household that they call the "thermostat".
These thermostats, small dials on the wall, somehow allow the people of this land to
keep their homes at whatever temperature they desire throughout the winter.

Curious, and hopeful that such a magical device might work in your own homes,
you send a small party to visit the towns in this not so far away land and to
learn about these thermostats.
They are instructed to observe these people and their devices, gather data,
and devise a plan for how your land can best solve the challenge of harsh winters.
The party takes off just as winter is setting in.

Weeks pass and the winter grows more bitter, but you hold faith that the research party will
provide answers.
As winter retires and spring emerges, the research party returns.

"Have you made adequate observations to understand what is happening?", you ask.
"We have.", they answer.
"And do you have a clear plan for how we might ease the bitter winters?"
"We do."
"Well, waste not another minute! What is your plan?"
"We must go to war with them. We must gain control of the thermostats."
"What? How will this help? How will this make a difference?"
"Well, you see, your highness, we observed for many weeks the activities of
these people and their strange devices.
We learned that rather than burning wood, they burn a liquid they call fuel.
This fuel is drawn from the ground and distributed to each of the homes.
Now, when they adjust the thermostat, they burn more or less fuel, depending on the adjustment.
"
