# Excellence

Excellence is about both personal mastery and the quality of the product we
produce.
Teams and individuals must be adequately challenged and be able to see true
progress toward a goal they aspire to.


It is not only important that people are connected to a mission or purpose, but
that they can see steady progress in their endeavor to achieve the desired end.
For knowledge workers, nothing is more important than making visible progress in meaningful work.
Studies to evaluate the makings of a "good" work day versus a "bad" work day found
that people feeling motivated and happy at the end of a given workday were highly
likely to have made some progress that same day. Conversely, if the person
drags out of the office disengaged and joyless, a setback is most likely to blame.

As it runs out, progress alone is not enough to maintain engagement.
The work has to be meaningful.
Meaningful not necessarily to the world at large, but meaningful to the individual
performing the work itself.
Certainly endeavors such as eradicating homelessness or curing cancer can bring
meaning to the work, but meaning can be as simple as making a quality product a
customer cares about and enjoys using.
Meaning can come from providing a service to a community or controlling costs
and increasing profits for one's employer.
Simple or grand, goals that are meaningful to the worker where one can see how
their efforts contribute to progress toward those goals can invigorate
inner work life and engagement.

Knowledge worker is term coined in the late 1950s by American management consultant,
educator, and author, Peter Drucker. Drucker considered knowledge work and
knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management.
While there is no formal definition of the term, Knowledge workers are generally
considered people whose work requires specific knowledge and problem solving
abilities, such as physicians, scientists, software engineers, and architects.

Most modern work is knowledge work.
Knowledge work need not be bolstered in any way to help workers find meaning.
Most knowledge work jobs are potentially meaningful for the people doing them.
The challenge is more in how management removes a sense of purpose from the work
and fails to draw clear connections between the work and the overall organizational
goals.
Managers need not make knowledge work more meaningful, but they do need to stop actively
stripping meaning from the work.

According to a study of hundreds of knowledge workers, there are four key ways
in which managers stripped work of its meaning -
Dismissing or completely ignoring the importance of people's work or ideas,
destroying people's sense of ownership through frequent reassignment,
giving people the impression that nobody will see, use, or benefit from their efforts,
and keeping people generally uninformed about project risks until they are realized.

Knowledge work is primarily about solving problems, often complex problems that
require specific knowledge and unique approaches.
For many knowledge workers, they've spent years studying and practicing before securing even an entry level job.
They're well educated, well informed, and experienced.
Many have worked in internships and other real world opportunities where they've
developed tacit knowledge to compliment the explicit knowledge acquired through
formal schooling.
The number one thing they have to contribute to work and to the cause is ideas.
Dismiss or ignore the key thing they have to contribute, and their motivation
is readily lost.

### Collective ownership is still ownership
Write about how complex problems require small diverse groups to solve them, but
this collective effort doesn't eliminate the sense of pride of ownership.
Moving people from project to project against their will/wishes disallows them
to develop a sense of connection and belonging.
Without a sense of ownership; an ability to see their work through, they can
lose motivation and drive.
