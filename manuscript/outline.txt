## Johanna Rothman
- 1000 copies sold is a runaway best seller for non-fiction business
- The more books I write, the more books I sell
- Having spoken with you, I think you have several books within you
- People like small and short books now
- Understand what you don't put in
- field stones
  - building blocks of your work
  - you cannot waste time doing this
- I write too much for the book
  - more verbose in my blog posts, but it helps with the book
- I would not suggest a publisher
  - Even Prags - they give you 50%
  - Self-publish: you get more money and can control the marketing/position
    - LeanPub
      - Markdown
        - can do sidebars, tips, warnings, etc.
        - don't have to deal with the crap
  - They want you to market your own book anyway
  - I make a lot more money when I sell them myself
    - I have total control over sales/marketing, design, etc.
    - Publisher markets THEMSELVES
      - You want a branded for you cover - not branded for them
- 45000 words - 15 chapters of 3000 words each => good reading length BUT a bit short for audio
  - Write and then edit
    - used to write chapter by chapter and have people review it
      - start writing chapter by chapter
      - realize I have to rant about a thing
        - agile traps was almost the first thing I wrote
        - start the chapters linearly, but almost never finish them that way
    - now ask people to review the entire thing at the end
    - I (Doc) need to decide for myself
  - Target one chapter per month (or some cadence)
- Most recent books
  - Mindmap and storymap
    - can send me storymap from prags
    - personally not an outliner
      - Do want to have frame it too heavily up front
- Question-driven writing
  - what are the three questions I want to answer in this chapter?
- Deciding on content
  - Ask myself several questions
    - She has 4 questions for every book.
  - Who is this for?
  - What will they get out of it?
- Here's what needs to be in this book
  - NOT - here's everything I know (on this topic)
- One of the best things I ever did was to start writing about my book while I was writing the book
  - Could also write articles
  - most often talk about stuff that is in the book
    - content that may be part of a chapter
    - content that will get the interest of others
  - How do you get people in your potential audience to start following you
    - they will most likely buy the book
- Johanna - writing workshops
  - Getting started
  - how to start to publish on a regular basis - writing workshop 2
  - Book writing workshop
    - Needs to be longer than 6 weeks, but not sure how to price it
