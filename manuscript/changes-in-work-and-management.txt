# The Accelerating Rate of Change

Management as a discipline is a relatively nascent concept.
Genetically, man can be traced to roughly six (6) million years ago when the ape
lineage divided into paths that would eventually lead separately to man and
to chimpanzees.
Anatomically, modern man is about 200,000 years old, beginning when the
subspecies of Homo sapiens evolved from archaic humans.
Behaviorally, modern man is closer to 40,000 years old.
Somewhere between 50,000 and 40,000 years ago, Homeo sapiens started to
exhibit behaviors of cognition, including abstract thinking, use of symbols,
and social learning.
30,000 years ago, humans were hunter gatherers with relatively crude instruments.
20,000 years ago, we created clay pottery and began use of raw materials.
10,000 years ago, we made significant advancements in that we started farming and
domesticated some animals to our purpose.
8,000 years ago, we first brewed beer.
6,500 years ago, we invented the plow.
6,000 years ago, we invented the wheel.
5,400 years ago, we began writing.
5,200 years ago, we added sails to boats.
5,000 years ago, we started mass producing and using bricks.
Palaces and cities were easier to build.
4,700 years ago, the first pyramids were built.
4,500 years ago, the first written laws were established.
2,800 years ago, the first olympics take place.
2,200 years ago, the great wall of china is constructed.
1,550 years ago, London is established.

Fast forward 39,900 years from the advent of behavioral modernity, and man
conceives of the notion of "management" as a role and discipline.

In the late 1800s

In 1965, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel made what at the time may have
seemed a simple observation. He noted that the number of transistors per square
inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since the integrated circuit
was first demonstrated by Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments in 1958.
Moore predicted that this rate of growth would continue for the
foreseeable future. A decade later, in 1975, he revised the forecast to indicate
a doubling every two years. This observation and prediction became commonly
known in the electronics and computer industry as "Moore's Law". Not an actual
physical or natural law, the name stuck none the less.

Moore's prediction held true until around 2012 when the rate fell from the
steady pace of the prior 37 years. In 2015, Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel,
confirmed that the pace has slowed to a doubling every two and a half years.

The impact of this has been tremendous. Computing power has essentially increased
exponentially for the better of 5 decades while the relative cost has decreased
at the same fundamental rate. With power and cost as two key drivers of
technological advancement, these trends in increased power and decreased cost have not
only contributed to the explosive growth of existing technologies, but have
enabled the launch of entirely new industries as well.

Through a series of advancements, computer chips have grown more powerful and
smaller at the same time, allowing for more computing power in smaller and
smaller components.
Advancements in integration and microelectromechanical
systems have resulted in accelerometers and gyroscopes in phones and even watches.
We wear devices on our wrists that measure our steps, altitude changes, and
sleep patterns.
These devices have more computing power than the systems that sent the first
men to the moon.
And they fit on our wrists!
Science fiction is becoming science fact right before our eyes.
