# Autonomy

Autonomy applies both to the individual and the team.
As pertains to the individual, autonomy is about having a voice in the
decisions that impact one's life and the freedom to choose a different course.
As pertains to the collective, autonomy is the right to self-organize and
self-govern.
In a corporate environment autonomy means leaving the decisions about how work
is done to those who actually do the work.
