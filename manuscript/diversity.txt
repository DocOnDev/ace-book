# Diversity

The more complex a problem, the less predictable the solution.
The less predictable the solution the more uncertainty.
The more uncertainty, the more varied the set of options we need to explore.
The more varied the options need to be, the more diverse the team generating the
options needs to be.
So, the more complex the problem, the more diverse the team needs to be.

The diversity we need is diversity of thought.
A truly diverse set of options would come from a group of people who see not only
the problem differently, but who see the world differently.
From the varied ingredients of their backgrounds and perspectives comes the recipe
for a truly unique and effective solution.

But how de we ensure diversity of thought?
We cannot see or touch thought.
We cannot sense it or measure it.
As a result, when we talk about diversity in most organizations what we mean is
a diversity of visible and other determinable differentiators.
We launch programs to show support for women in STEM and leadership roles.
We more deliberately recruit from colleges that have a student population that differs
from our own.
But do these efforts achieve the end we desire?
The verdict is out at the moment, but the science is promising.
At it turns out, visible differentiators, while relatively poor proxies for actual difference
in thought create an interesting phenomenon.
When we introduce an individual who looks different to a group, the group assumes
the new individual thinks differently than they do.
This in turn, causes the group to think differently.
Let's say we have a team whose been together for a while.
They all have the same gender identity and look relatively similar to one another.
They've similar educational backgrounds, work experience, and income levels.
They were all raised in the same general geographic region and share the same
colloquial language patterns.
So we can fairly safely assume that they think similarly to one another.
If we introduce another member to the group; someone they've not previously met.
Someone with a similar educational background, work experience, and income level.
But someone who looks significantly different - perhaps they identify differently
and have a significantly different complexion.
They were actually raised in the same geographic region but were raised in a
household where english was a second language and they have an accent.
The group will rapidly identify this individual as an outsider; as different.
As a result, they will expect the new member to think about problems in a different way.
This actually causes the existing members to change the way that they think.
So by introducing visual differentiators to a group, we are introducing diversity of
thought, not necessarily because the new member adds diversity of thought, but
because the existing group members change their thought process.
