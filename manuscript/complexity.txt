## Simple
- Stability
- Clear cause and effect
- Sense, categorize, respond.
- Best Practices.

A simple context is stable with clear cause and effect relationships that are easily discerned by most everyone.
There is a best way to perform the task; a best practice.
Often this best practice is self-evident.
In cases where the optimal solution is not self-evident, minimal expertise is required.


Early on in my career, I landed a job working in a mail room for a major law firm.
Nothing glamorous, to be sure.
But for a college drop-out of 20-something with a new wife and a baby,
steady pay and covering our bills were high on my list of priorities.
Glamour, on the other hand, was pretty close to the bottom of that list.

Working in the mail room was a physically taxing job
and to be successful, you needed to not only be able to keep up the pace,
but be able to keep track of multiple requests and get them done.
We did mail runs three times per day; one at 8:30am, one at 1:30pm, and one at 5:00pm.
Each run consisted of 4 routes.
Most times, four employees went out, each taking a single route. Now and then, you'd have to take two routes.
For each route, there were approximately 75 stops where you checked for outgoing mail and dropped off any incoming mail.
The majority of the stops were simply baskets atop a secretary's workstation.
On average, a secretary worked with three attorneys.
This meant that on a single route, you were handling mail for as many as 300 people.
When you got back to the mailroom, you needed to sort your cart by intra-office, inter-office, and outbound mail.

While on a run, you were guaranteed to get additional requests.
"Hey Michael, can you do me a favor, hmmm?
Mr. Thompson needs new batteries in his dictaphone.
Can you be a doll and send some back to me in the mail next run? Thanks so much."
"You there, office boy, um.. Oh, whatever your name is.
The corner conference room is a mess.
Get someone to clean it up before 2pm. I have an important meeting. Goddamn slobs..."

And I can assure you from personal experience,
Mr. too important to remember your name will recall it perfectly if that office is not cleaned up by 2pm.

Now when we weren't doing runs and taking care of random errands,
we were receiving packages from several over the road carriers as well as local couriers.
Packages would come in, either direct to the mailroom or through the docks.
We'd burst, sort, categorize, slot, weigh and stamp all in preparation for the next run.

Whenever the remote office bags got full, we'd transfer the contents of the bag
into a large box and label it for overnight delivery to the appropriate office.
At the end of the day, no matter how much content was in each office's bag, it
got packaged, labeled, and shipped.





Problems in domain:
- Improper classifications of issues
- Entrained thinking
- Complacency


## Compound
- Cause and effect still determinable
- Multiple paths to solution
- Good practices.

There is still a clear relationship between cause and effect, but the context is interconnected enough
that there are multiple equally good ways to preform the task.
There are good practices, but not necessarily best practices.

## Emergent

## Chaotic
