# Work Types

Need a basic description of work types here.

Perhaps a reference to Cynefin.

## Simple
Early on in my career, I landed a job working in a mail room for a major law firm.
Nothing glamorous, to be sure.
But for a college drop-out of 20-something with a new wife and a baby,
steady pay and covering our bills were high on my list of priorities.
Glamour, on the other hand, was pretty close to the bottom of that list.

Working in the mail room was a physically taxing job
and to be successful, you needed to not only be able to keep up the pace,
but be able to keep track of multiple requests and get them done.

We did mail runs three times per day; one at 8:30am, one at 1:30pm, and one at 5:00pm.
Each run consisted of 4 routes.
Most times, four employees went out, each taking a single route. Now and then, you'd have to take two routes.
For each route, there were approximately 75 stops where you checked for outgoing mail and dropped off any incoming mail.
The majority of the stops were baskets or trays atop a secretary's workstation.
On average, a secretary worked with three attorneys.
This meant that on a single route, you were handling mail for as many as 300 people.
If you caught a double, you were handling mail for 600.
When you got back to the mailroom, you needed to sort your cart by intra-office, inter-office, and outbound mail.

While on a run, you were guaranteed to get additional requests.

> "Hey Michael, can you do me a favor, hmmm?
Mr. Thompson needs new batteries in his dictaphone.
Can you be a doll and send some back to me in the mail next run? Thanks so much."

> "You there, office boy, um.. Oh, whatever your name is.
The corner conference room is a mess.
Get someone to clean it up before 2pm. I have an important meeting. Goddamn slobs..."

And I can assure you from personal experience,
Mr. Too-important-to-remember-your-name will recall it perfectly if that office is not cleaned up by 2pm.

Now when we weren't doing runs and taking care of random errands,
we were receiving packages from several over the road carriers as well as local couriers.
Packages would come in, either direct to the mailroom or through the docks.
We'd burst, sort, categorize, slot, weigh and stamp all in preparation for the next run.

Whenever the remote office bags got full, we'd transfer the contents of the bag
into a large box and label it for overnight delivery to the appropriate office.
At the end of the day, no matter how much content was in each office's bag, it
got packaged, labeled, and shipped.

Our Manager was a man named Greg. Greg had worked the mailroom for years
and he'd worked another in a firm across town for several years prior to that.
We had two PCs in the mailroom; the first two PCs in the firm.
One for creating FedEx labels. The other for UPS.
It was the late 80s and aside from those two devices,
not much about mailrooms had changed in the prior 20 years.
Greg knew it inside and out. He knew all the courier companies in town.
He knew most of their owners.
If we had a problem with a courier package,
he didn't bother with the standard channels,
he called the owner's desk phone direct.
He knew every FedEx and UPS delivery person.
He knew the crews working the docks.
He knew all the freight elevator operators.
He knew the building maintenance and management crews.
He even knew the people who supplied and repaired dictation equipment.
He knew just about everything there was to know about every possible aspect of running that mailroom.
I say "just about" only to leave room for an extremely remote possibility,
but the truth is, as far as I could tell, Greg knew it all and then some.

We had straight forward procedures for most everything.
There was a way we ran the routes and a way we sorted the mail.
There was paperwork and procedure for FedEx and UPS.
We had a process for courier requests and policies covering the handling of legal briefs and discovery documents.
There was a documented procedure for how the Pitney Bowes collator was used.

Notes and instructions were all about.
There were labels on every compartment in the sorting wall.
Procedures were posted above the large equipment
and laminated instructions were next to the PCs.

If you didn't know how to do something, you asked your co-workers. If they didn't know, Greg knew.

If you had an idea about how to improve the process, you spoke with Greg.
He'd listen patiently, often with a look of mild amusement;
a kindly appreciation for your naive contribution.
He'd tell you he'd think about it. He always said he'd think about it.
Greg rarely said "no" at the presentation of an idea, no matter how many times he'd heard it before.
Later that day or early the next,
Greg would tell you a story about a time someone did something similar to your suggestion
and an attorney was angered by the resultant inconvenience,
a paralegal had to deliver a package themselves,
or a filing failed to make it to the court by the deadline.
The procedures existed to avoid error and to ensure the mailroom ran efficiently.
These were the best practices available and they'd been proven over time.

Simple work is not necessarily easy work.
We kept busy,
we operated efficiently,
and we ended many days physically exhausted.
To accomplish the work, you needed a strong back and a good memory (or a trusty notepad).
In addition to these, you needed to be able to read and write and pattern match.
But that was truly the extent of it.
There was no extensive training or even orientation for the role.
Most of our work was reading (or listening),
determining what category this work fit into, and acting out a series of steps.
Intraoffice mail is placed in the sorting bin with the matching name.
Interoffice mail is placed in the correct outbound office bag.
Cross-town same-day deliveries require a courier slip and are placed in the outbound courier bin.
US Mail gets a postage label generated via the Pitney Bowes machine and is placed in the mail bin.
There were dozens of procedures and policies in place to cleanly, clearly,
and efficiently guide us in the execution of our work.

This is the nature of simple work.
From the mailroom to the filing room to the stock yards and manufacturing floors
of the 1900s when top-down hierarchical management first proved far superior
to the less structured work environments of the day.
Simple work can be entirely understood and
a single person can and often does know the entire domain.
Workers need not solve new or unique problems
or even understand how the overall system works.
They only need to be able to sense, categorize, and respond according to procedure.
Creativity is not necessary and is often unwelcome.
In fact, deviance from standard can create an unstable system
resulting in loss of efficiency and resource.

While typically quite effective, the hierarchical approach to simple work
is not entirely risk free. To begin with, management cannot be at all places at
all times. It is possible a worker or group of workers will fail to properly categorize
the work before them and will execute a process that hinders the system. Say, for example,
the mailroom staff was not aware that an attorney was visiting the Chicago office from
the D.C. office to work on a key case. We'd route correspondence to D.C. per procedure,
ensuring at least a 24 hour delay in delivery as the D.C. mailroom would then need
to forward the item on to Chicago. Not properly marked, Chicago might categorize
this as a mis-routed item and dutifully and efficiently send it back to D.C.

While these may be minor inconveniences that have little impact, a 24 hour delay
in a time sensitive case may result in a missed filing or a violation of discovery
rules or any other number of detrimental outcomes. Cases have been lost, millions
of dollars have been paid out, and people's lives have been ruined simply because
a key piece of information didn't get to counsel on time or a procedural requirement
was missed with the courts.

In a simple context, there is the additional risk of entrenched thinking and complacency.
Best practices become sacrosanct. They are proven. The are best. As such,
they cannot be bettered. Once one has mastered a simple domain and put a working
system in place, they may not realize the need to continue to monitor and adjust over time.

With the introduction of alternate delivery services,
desktop computers, email, and eventually intranets, the mailroom was slow to
adopt any of the advances. For years, supplies were requested via a simple procedure.
An employee would complete a supply requisition form and drop it in their outbound mail box.
This was a pressure form that made two additional copies, allowing the original and one copy
to route to the mailroom and providing the requestor a copy for their own records.
The mailroom would pull the supplies, checking off each item as they went. They
would then separate the second copy from the original and send it back in the supply package
as a record of having satisfied the request. This original, once completed, was filed
for 12 months and then disposed of.

Once email became ubiquitous, people wanted to be able to shoot off an email rather than
filling out a paper form. The mailroom agreed and set up a computer to help process these requests.
An operator, who sat at a desk in the file room, processed each email request,
transposing it onto the standard form. The original with attached first copy was
routed to the mailroom for completion. The second copy was routed to the requestor.
On the next run, both items were collected and taken to the mailroom for processing.
The requestor's copy would be placed in their outbound bin. The supplies would then be picked
and packaged and placed in the requestor's outbound bin. The original would get filed.
On the next run, the requestor would receive their supplies and two transposed paper copies of their
email request, one with checkmarks and one without. They would, of course, throw away
both copies.

There was clearly a better way to do this work, but forms in triplicate had so
long stood as the best practice, they persisted without question as the changing
environment transformed them from providing value to complete waste.

This example shows the folly and even humor of entrenched thinking and complacency.
Forms in duplicate that need not exist are a minor issue within a large
organization.

### Summary

A simple context is stable with clear cause and effect relationships that are easily discerned by most everyone.
There is a best way to perform each task; a best practice, which is either self-evident
or easily conveyed with minimal training.

Management is top-down and this hierarchy helps to ensure that each individual is
being fully, optimally utilized in a system as predictable and efficient as possible.
Workers spend their time sensing, categorizing, and responding by executing the
pre-determined procedures. Creativity and problem solving are rare activities
in this context and are primarily the responsibility of management.

The key risks here are mis-categorization and entrenched thinking. Mis-categorization
results in execution of the wrong procedure. For the mailroom at a major law firm, as an example,
the impact can range from a minor inconvenience, such as non-critical materials being delivered late,
to loss of a case or a key client, possibly even heavy fines and jail time. Entrenched thinking
results in lost opportunity. For any company that operates in a simple context, this
can mean a less than optimally efficient operation and loss of profit due to waste.
It can also mean losing market share to companies more responsive and nimble in the
face of change. Sufficiently entrenched companies can be run out of business whilst
they struggle against their own inertia.

Much of what we know today as management was formulated in this context.
Frederick Winslow Taylor, the creator of Scientific Management and one of the most
influential businessmen of the 19th and 20th centuries, formulated most of
his theories and practices on factory floors and in work yards where the work was
physically taxing, but cognitively simple.


## Compound

As I mentioned, there were two computers in the mailroom. One for processing FedEx
and one for processing UPS. The computers were nearly identical save the software running
on them and the printer attached. The software and printers were provided by the carrier.
The computers were property of the law firm.

Now and then, the printer would jam or the computer would fail to perform its assigned duty.
I was a computer hobbyist as a teen and was comfortable around computers. I had limited
experience with the inner-workings of a computer, but had no qualms about hooking
up serial devices, toggling interrupt switches, or fiddling with peripherals in general.
This was sufficient to elevate me to the mailroom's technical support position.
If the printer jammed or the software needed an update, I was your man. If cycling the
power didn't fix a glitch, I was informed right away.

One day, the FedEx computer died. I think it was a bad power supply, but back then
I just knew it was "busted". Computers were expensive, in short supply, and priority
went to the secretaries of partners and senior associates.
We weren't going to get a new computer for weeks, if at all.
So, I went about figuring out how to get both programs and printers working
on a single computer. A couple of hours reading the manual and fumbling around and I
had both printers working. Another hour and I had both pieces of software installed on the machine.
I additionally installed the firm's standard menu system and wrote up some brief instructions
on how to exit one program and launch the other. Not too long thereafter, I found myself
working full time in the computer room as a junior PC technician.

This role was new to the firm. All of our word processing was done on a WANG
mainframe system through dumb terminals. In the prior months, we'd started
buying PCs as replacements for terminals. The PCs were cheaper and we could get them
in days rather than weeks.

We'd purchase maybe one computer per week to replace a broken terminal or to outfit a new secretary.
As each PC came in, we'd open the case and install a WANG Local Office Connection Card (WLOC Card).
We'd configure switches on the motherboard to allow for the WLOC Card.
We'd configure some additional switches on the card, assigning each a unique address. We'd then test
the connection and install the computer at the user's desk, connecting it to the
mainframe through the same coax cables the dumb terminals used.
This should have been a simple repeatable process, but the firm bought these
machines one at a time from the lowest cost provider they could find.
That meant that one week we were preparing an IBM machine,
the next week was Hyundai (yes, that Hyundai), and the week after that was some
unknown local brand that was out of business the week after. Nearly every
machine was unique on some way. The switches on the motherboard were in different locations
and indicated different things. This was often true between machines from the same provider, received in the same shipment.
Every install required us to analyze the machine's internals, figure out the configuration,
and decide on a course of action.

About six months in, some of us in the computer room started messing around with
a local area network (LAN). It allowed us to connect machines together without the mainframe
and it allowed us to share files and communicate with each other from different machines.
With this new capability, computers became all the rage within the firm.
We hired contractors to re-wire the entire building with 10baseT wiring and we
settled on a single vendor for all new computers.
We replaced WLOC Cards with Network Interface Controller Cards (NIC Cards) and installed
an emulator. We switched from a terminal-based word processor to WordPerfect. Computers
replaced every dumb terminal in the company. Suddenly attorneys needed computers too
as our internal library could not keep up with the growing demand for computer time
to search the LexisNexis system and legal bulletin boards (this was before the World Wide Web).

Before long, we were running a full PC support desk. Employees would call the
hotline and we'd try to walk them through their issues. In many cases, we were
helping folks with tricky features in WordPerfect or walking them through adding
a new software option to their menu system. In other cases, the PCs were physically broken.

A physically broken PC was collected and returned to the support desk.
There, we'd review any notes that came with the PC, analyze the machine, narrow our
list of possible issues, and decide on a course of action. In the beginning, our
standard course of action was to verify an issue, fill out a service sheet and
set the machine aside to go out to a professional repair shop. Some days, there would
be as many as a dozen machines sitting in a stack for repair.

Bored while on a break and sitting on a chair in front of the repair stack, it
occurred to me that we could reduce turn-around if we could actually fix the machines
ourselves. We already had the tools to take them apart. We knew how to add and remove
peripherals. We knew how to run some basic diagnostics. We should be able to do this.

I started by consolidating issues. I wasn't really fixing the problems, but I was
reducing the number of people affected. Say several PCs were waiting for repair.
If one had a bad video card and one had a bad hard drive, I'd swap the video cards.
Now we had one working machine and one with both a bad card and bad hard drive.

A common problem with bad hard drives was the controller card. The drive itself
was fine, but the logic board that controlled it was bad. I kept a few good controller
cards on the desk. If a "bad hard drive" came in, I'd swap the controller card to
see if that worked. If it did, I'd swap the bad card for a good one in a different
machine already going out for repair and update the service note to indicate this
one also had a bad disk controller.

I rapidly got better at analyzing the problems in more detail. I could figure out
if a bad drive was the controller, a head crash, or another of a dozen possibilities.
I could remove and solder common chips, bringing motherboards back to life. And I
could often order replacement parts and install them myself for less than the cost
of the professional repair shop.

To be good at this job, you had to be able to make observations, investigate several
options, and choose a course of action. It required more experience and specific
knowledge. The more you learned about the domain, the better you got at the analysis
and the better your decisions about how to proceed.

This is the nature of compound work.
The analysis is required, not just categorization. You need to be able to choose
from a number of options. And there are often equally correct paths to the solution.
So while there are good practices, there are not necessarily best practices.
Workers need to be able to solve problems on their own.
While a manager can set procedures for how to execute the discrete parts, a
manager must rely on the knowledge of the worker to analyze the situation.
It is valuable here for workers to understand as much about the system as they can.


- Cause and effect still determinable
- Multiple paths to solution
- Good practices.

There is still a clear relationship between cause and effect, but the context is interconnected enough
that there are multiple equally good ways to preform the task.
There are good practices, but not necessarily best practices.
