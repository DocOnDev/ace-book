## Simple
Early on in my career, I landed a job working in a mail room for a major law firm.
Nothing glamorous, to be sure.
But for a college drop-out of 20-something with a new wife and a baby,
steady pay and covering our bills were high on my list of priorities.
Glamour, on the other hand, was pretty close to the bottom of that list.

Working in the mail room was a physically taxing job
and to be successful, you needed to not only be able to keep up the pace,
but be able to keep track of multiple requests and get them done.

We did mail runs three times per day; one at 8:30am, one at 1:30pm, and one at 5:00pm.
Each run consisted of 4 routes.
Most times, four employees went out, each taking a single route. Now and then, you'd have to take two routes.
For each route, there were approximately 75 stops where you checked for outgoing mail and dropped off any incoming mail.
The majority of the stops were baskets or trays atop a secretary's workstation.
On average, a secretary worked with three attorneys.
This meant that on a single route, you were handling mail for as many as 300 people.
If you caught a double, you were handling mail for 600.
When you got back to the mailroom, you needed to sort your cart by intra-office, inter-office, and outbound mail.

While on a run, you were guaranteed to get additional requests.

> "Hey Michael, can you do me a favor, hmmm?
Mr. Thompson needs new batteries in his dictaphone.
Can you be a doll and send some back to me in the mail next run? Thanks so much."

> "You there, office boy, um.. Oh, whatever your name is.
The corner conference room is a mess.
Get someone to clean it up before 2pm. I have an important meeting. Goddamn slobs..."

And I can assure you from personal experience,
Mr. Too-important-to-remember-your-name will recall it perfectly if that office is not cleaned up by 2pm.

Now when we weren't doing runs and taking care of random errands,
we were receiving packages from several over the road carriers as well as local couriers.
Packages would come in, either direct to the mailroom or through the docks.
We'd burst, sort, categorize, slot, weigh and stamp all in preparation for the next run.

Whenever the remote office bags got full, we'd transfer the contents of the bag
into a large box and label it for overnight delivery to the appropriate office.
At the end of the day, no matter how much content was in each office's bag, it
got packaged, labeled, and shipped.

Our Manager was a man named Greg. Greg had worked the mailroom for years
and he'd worked another in a firm across town for several years prior to that.
We had two PCs in the mailroom; the first two PCs in the firm.
One for creating FedEx labels. The other for UPS.
It was the late 80s and aside from those two devices,
not much about mailrooms had changed in the prior 20 years.
Greg knew it inside and out. He knew all the courier companies in town.
He knew most of their owners.
If we had a problem with a courier package,
he didn't bother with the standard channels,
he called the owner's desk phone direct.
He knew every FedEx and UPS delivery person.
He knew the crews working the docks.
He knew all the freight elevator operators.
He knew the building maintenance and management crews.
He even knew the people who supplied and repaired dictation equipment.
He knew just about everything there was to know about every possible aspect of running that mailroom.
I say "just about" only to leave room for an extremely remote possibility,
but the truth is, as far as I could tell, Greg knew it all and then some.

We had straight forward procedures for most everything.
There was a way we ran the routes and a way we sorted the mail.
There was paperwork and procedure for FedEx and UPS.
We had a process for courier requests and policies covering the handling of legal briefs and discovery documents.
There was a documented procedure for how the Pitney Bowes collator was used.

Notes and instructions were all about.
There were labels on every compartment in the sorting wall.
Procedures were posted above the large equipment
and laminated instructions were next to the PCs.

If you didn't know how to do something, you asked your co-workers. If they didn't know, Greg knew.

If you had an idea about how to improve the process, you spoke with Greg.
He'd listen patiently, often with a look mild amusement; a kindly appreciation for your naive contribution.
He'd tell you he'd think about it. He always said he'd think about it.
Greg rarely said "no" at the presentation of an idea, no matter how many times he'd heard it before.
Later that day or early the next,
Greg would tell you a story about a time someone did something similar to your suggestion
and an attorney was angered by the resultant inconvenience,
a paralegal had to deliver a package themselves,
or a filing failed to make it to the court by the deadline.
The procedures existed to avoid error and to ensure the mailroom ran efficiently.
These were the best practices available and they'd been proven over time.

For how taxing it was and the number of processes and procedures involved, it was still simple work.

### Sense, Categorize, Respond

Simple work is not necessarily easy.
We kept busy.
We operated efficiently.
I ended most days physically exhausted.
You needed a good memory (or a trusty notepad) and you needed to be able to read and write and pattern match.
But that was truly the extent of it.
There was no extensive training or even orientation for the role.
Most of our work was reading (or listening), determining what category this work fit into, and acting out a series of steps.
Intraoffice mail in placed it in the sorting bin with the matching name.
Interoffice mail is placed in the correct outbound office bag.
Cross-town same-day deliveries require a courier slip and are placed in the outbound courier bin.
US Mail gets a postage label generated via the Pitney Bowes machine and is placed in the mail bin.
There were dozens of procedures and policies in place to cleanly, clearly, and efficiently guide us in the execution of our work.

This is the nature of simple work.
From the mailroom to the filing room to the stock yards and manufacturing floors
of the 1900s when top-down hierarchical management first proved far superior
to the less structured work environments of the day.
Simple work can be entirely understood.
A single person can know the entire domain.
Workers need not solve new or unique problems.
They need not understand how the overall system works.
They only need to be able to sense, categorize, and respond according to procedure.
Creativity is not necessary and often unwelcome.
In fact, deviance from standard can create an unstable system resulting in loss of efficiency and resource.


### Summary

- Stability
- Clear cause and effect
- Sense, categorize, respond.
- Best Practices.

A simple context is stable with clear cause and effect relationships that are easily discerned by most everyone.
There is a best way to perform the task; a best practice.
Often this best practice is self-evident.
In cases where the optimal solution is not self-evident, minimal expertise is required.

Problems in domain:
- Improper classifications of issues
- Entrained thinking
- Complacency


## Compound
- Cause and effect still determinable
- Multiple paths to solution
- Good practices.

There is still a clear relationship between cause and effect, but the context is interconnected enough
that there are multiple equally good ways to preform the task.
There are good practices, but not necessarily best practices.

## Emergent

## Chaotic
