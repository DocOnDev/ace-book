## Simple
- Stability
- Clear cause and effect
- Sense, categorize, respond.
- Best Practices.

A simple context is stable with clear cause and effect relationships that are easily discerned by most everyone.
There is a best way to perform the task; a best practice.
Often this best practice is self-evident.
In cases where the optimal solution is not self-evident, minimal expertise is required.

Problems in domain:
- Improper classifications of issues
- Entrained thinking
- Complacency

## Compound
There is still a clear relationship between cause and effect, but the context is interconnected enough that there are multiple equally good ways to preform the task.
There are good practices, but not necessarily best practices.

## Emergent

## Chaotic
