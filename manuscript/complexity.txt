# Complexity and Management

In 1965, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel made what at the time may have
seemed a simple observation. He noted that the number of transistors per square
inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since the integrated circuit
was first demonstrated by Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments in 1958.
Moore predicted that this rate of growth would continue for the
foreseeable future. A decade later, in 1975, he revised the forecast to indicate
a doubling every two years. This observation and prediction became commonly
known in the electronics and computer industry as "Moore's Law". Not an actual
physical or natural law, the name stuck none the less.

Moore's prediction held true until around 2012 when the rate fell from the
steady pace of the prior 37 years. In 2015, Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel,
confirmed that the pace has slowed to a doubling every two and a half years.

The impact of this has been tremendous. Computing power has essentially increased
exponentially for the better of 5 decades while the relative cost has decreased
at the same fundamental rate. With power and cost as two key drivers of
technological advancement, these trends in increased power and decreased cost have not
only contributed to the explosive growth of existing technologies, but have
enabled the launch of entirely new industries as well.

Through a series of advancements, computer chips have grown more powerful and
smaller at the same time, allowing for more computing power in smaller and
smaller components.
Advancements in integration and microelectromechanical
systems have resulted in accelerometers and gyroscopes in phones and even watches.
We wear devices on our wrists that measure our steps, altitude changes, and
sleep patterns.
These devices have more computing power than the systems that sent the first
men to the moon.
And they fit on our wrists!
Science fiction is becoming science fact right before our eyes.

Perhaps less immediately obvious yet more socially and economically significant
is the impact these advances have had on our work lives.
