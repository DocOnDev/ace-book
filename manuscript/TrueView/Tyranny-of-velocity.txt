# The Torment of Velocity

Velocity is perhaps the most often used metric in all of agility.
Velocity as a concept is derived from a number of different ideas, most of which
stem from Extreme Programming (XP). Around the year 2000, early XP concepts of
"individual velocity", "load factors", and "ideal days" evolved into
"Story Points" and "Team Velocity" as practitioners learned what worked well and what did not.
In 2002, Scrum adopted the concept of Velocity and made it a part of their certification
programs. Unfortunately, Scrum failed to early adopt many of the other XP engineering
practices and perspectives that actually supported the concept of Velocity and
kept it in appropriate balance. This lead to the proliferation of a metric
ill-suited to the environments in which it was being applied.

Over the course of the 15 ensuing years, practitioners all over the world continued
to iterate on existing practices and experiment with new concepts, many of which
were derived from other disciplines. We will refer to these folks as experimenters.
They focus on experimentation and learning as a part of an empirical and sometimes scientific process.

During that same 15 year timeframe, Scrum Certification
became a booming business and Velocity was adopted as a means of prediction,
commitment, and accountability for teams new to agility who found comfort in the
idea that work can be predicted and committed to and that teams and individuals should
be held accountable for their inability to execute against these predictions and commitments.
We will refer to these folks as implementers.
They focus on implementing process and procedures well in an effort to achieve efficient and accurate outcomes.
