# Connection

Connection is multi-faceted. It is about connection to the company's cause,
connection to the customer, personal connection to your fellow workers, and
being connected through communication channels.

Connection is a crucial partner to Autonomy.
Autonomy without Connection leads to strife.
Without connection to a cause and to one another, there's no shared direction,
no continuity, and inconsistent accountability.

Connection is a crucial partner to Excellence.
Excellence without Connection leads to fiefdoms.
Without a shared purpose and empathy for one another, excellence is too narrowly
focused. Teams compete with teams and divisions compete with divisions.
What should have been an advantage to the organization becomes detrimental.

Connection is a crucial partner to Diversity.
