# Connection

Connection is multi-faceted. It is about connection to the company's cause,
connection to the customer, personal connection to your fellow workers, and
being connected through communication channels.

Connection is a crucial partner to Autonomy.
Autonomy without Connection leads to chaos.
Without connection to a cause and to one another, there's no shared direction,
no continuity, and inconsistent accountability.

Connection is a crucial partner to Excellence.
Excellence without Connection leads to strife.
Without a shared purpose and empathy for one another, excellence is too narrowly
focused. Teams compete with teams and divisions compete with divisions.

Connection is a crucial partner to Diversity.
Diversity without Connection leads to fiefdoms.
