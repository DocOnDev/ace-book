# Connection

Connection is multi-faceted. It is about connection to the company's purpose,
connection to the customer, personal connection to your fellow workers, and
being connected through communication channels.

## Aligned with the cause
It is commonplace for companies to have mission and vision statements these days.
Once identified as a differentiator (Good to Great?), the mission statement is
now pervasive and benign. It isn't that too many companies having a mission statement
has stripped such statements of value. It is simply that there are so many valueless
mission statements, most employees scoff at their existence.

With Fortune 500 companies sporting missions statements such as,
"Profitable growth through superior customer service, innovation, quality and
commitment." to, "The purpose of [our company] is to earn money for its
shareholders and increase the value of their investment. We will do that
through growing the company, controlling assets and properly structuring the
balance sheet, thereby increasing EPS, cash flow, and return on invested capital."

These mission statements don't tell us a thing about the company, why they
exist, or what services or goods they actually offer.
With a focus on profit, growth, or return on shareholder value, these companies seem
to think they exist to make money.
Customer service and quality of product are a means to an end; sustainable profits
in service of shareholders.
Having been both a shareholder and employee of a number of companies, I can tell
you shareholder value was way down on the list of things that inspired me.
I was excited by the notion of "Making the World of Software Development
a Better Place to Work" or "Empowering the Local Business".
When I first arrived at Groupon, the phrase "Love Local" was part of the culture.
From T-Shirts, to banners and coffee mugs, everyone knew why we were there
- to empower the local business.
Mom and Pop businesses.
Companies that are founded by your neighbors, employ your neighbors, and care
about your local community because they are genuinely members of said community.



When the founding CEO was asked to step down and one of the primary investors
stepped in to the CEO role, the company lost almost all connection with the mission.

In the interest of return on shareholder value, the
company expanded into different verticals trying to catch more lightening in a
bottle and keep their inflated valuation high.

I remember when the travel division, known as "Getaways" was started.
I asked how this fit in with local businesses.
"Oh, well you see, we're pointing people to bed and breakfast companies.
The customer may be traveling, but we're still helping them discover new local businesses.
Businesses that are local to where they are at the moment."

"Interesting twist.". I thought.
But that's not actually how it played out.
The site launched with extremely limited options.
Groupon was faced with the arduous task of building an inventory of local
hotels and bed & breakfast joints or they could partner with a provider that had
hotels available in most major cities and have a complete vertical overnight.
Despite a sales and customer service department adept at growing a business
through direct sales and personal vendor service and despite deep cash
reserves, this time Groupon opted for the fast path to profitability and
Getaways became the new model.
Launch it fast, scale it faster, and push it to profitable or kill it.
First bolster the top line, then squeeze to get the bottom line.

Expanding into and abandoning verticals in an effort to provide a better return
on shareholder value, the company became progressively fractured and internally
competitive.
Each new vertical knew that they were going to "save the company".
Big egos and grand plans abound, internal competition was encouraged.
Winners were lavished with praise and losers were exited.
Heroes rose and fell in grand displays as the reality of the environment showed
us time and again that success and skill are not necessarily correlated under
these conditions.
We bred bullies and then chastised them for not playing nice with others once they
were no longer too valuable to mess with.
Once united in a common cause, people were now members of "Getaways" or "Goods"
or "Payments" or "Live" or "Local" or any of a number of fleeting and
flailing efforts.

In an effort to show that the company had indeed not lost its way, the CEO
eventually redefined "Local" to mean "anywhere a consumer is".
He spoke of the "Shopping Mall in your pocket."
If you are inspired by the notion of empowering local mom and pop businesses, you
are likley repulsed by the notion of a shopping mall, in pocket or otherwise.
This new definition was an attempt to create a thin thread between the original
inspiration and the new (aparent) mission to sell anything to anybody anywhere
in pursuit of a buck.
Those who were inspired by the original mission were not fooled.
Those who were more aligned to their vertical were not inspired.
A few years focused on money over mission and Groupon leadership drove the
company into the ground.
As of this writing, the second CEO has stepped down and there is a new CEO in
his place.



To be in business in order to make money is like to be alive in order to eat.
You've got it backwards and the decisions you make as a result are more likely
to be detrimental than beneficial.
Greed leads to poor corporate health as surely as gluttony leads to poor personal health.

And then let's take a look at the following Fortune 500 company mission statement:

"We will build a unique portfolio of beauty and related brands, striving to surpass our
competitors in quality, innovation and value, and elevating our image to become the
beauty company most women turn to worldwide. We will become the destination store for
women, offering the convenience of multiple brands and channels, and providing a
personal high touch shopping experience that helps create lifelong customer relationships.
We will expand our presence in direct selling and lead the reinvention of the channel,
offering an entrepreneurial opportunity that delivers superior earnings, recognition,
service and support, making it easy and rewarding to be affiliated with [us] and elevating
the image of our industry. We will be known for our leadership edge, through our passion
for high standards, our respect for diversity and our commitment to create exceptional
opportunities for professional growth so that associates can fulfill their highest potential.
We will be a committed global champion for the health and well-being of women through
philanthropic efforts that eliminate breast cancer from the face of the earth,
and that empower women to achieve economic independence. We will deliver superior
returns to our shareholders by tirelessly pursuing new growth opportunities while
continually improving our profitability, a socially responsible, ethical company
that is watched and emulated as a model of success."

If we were to create a formula for


## Attentive to the customer

## Empathy
## Communication

Connection is both internal and external.
Connection is what makes a community.
Internally, organizations need cohesion within and between all teams;
one collective, united toward a common cause.
External connection is engagement with a community through sincere dialogue
and contribution, where bolstering your brand is a side effect,
not a primary objective.
